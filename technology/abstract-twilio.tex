\section{Twilio}
Twilio is a cloud communications platform as a service (PaaS) company. It allows
software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send
and receive text messages using its web service APIs. Twilio's services are
accessed over HTTP and are billed based on usage.

Twilio uses Amazon Web Services to host telephony infrastructure and provide
connectivity between HTTP and the public switched telephone network (PSTN)
through its APIs.

Twilio follows a set of architectural design principles to protect against
unexpected outages, and received praise for staying online during the widespread
Amazon Web Services outage. It supports the development of open-source software
and regularly makes contributions to the open-source community. \cite{Twilio}
