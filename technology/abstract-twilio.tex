\section{Twilio}
Twilio is a cloud communications platform as a service (PaaS) company. It allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages using its web service APIs. Twilio's services are accessed over HTTP and are billed based on usage.

Twilio uses Amazon Web Services to host telephony infrastructure and provide connectivity between HTTP and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) through its APIs.

Twilio follows a set of architectural design principles to protect against unexpected outages, and received praise for staying online during the widespread Amazon Web Services outage. It supports the development of open-source software and regularly makes contributions to the open-source community. \cite{Openstack}
