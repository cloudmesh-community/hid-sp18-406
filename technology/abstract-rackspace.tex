\section{Rackspace}

Rackspace is a cloud computing company which adminitrates cloud system for their
business partners and further helping them to concentrate on managing the
business growth of their partners. Rackspace differenciates itself from other
companies by stating that the cloud system alone which is provided by other
companies is not sufficient to operate the infrastructure efficiently.

Rackspace proudly states that it takes several innovative and cognitive
engineering skills to develop and manage the infrastructure and also
concentrating on tools and applications which are necessary to administrate. BY
providing all such tool s with updated data engines and ecommerce platforms,
Rackspace claims that it will manage cloud and infrastruture of their business
partners in a much different and efficient way. \cite{Rackspace}
