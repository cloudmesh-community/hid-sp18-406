\section{Rackspace}
Rackspace is a managed cloud computing company which manages the cloud for their
business partners so that they can concentrate on managing business. Rackspace
claims that other companies will rent to provide raw computing infrastructure,
but for the customers (who are renting) that this cloud alone isnt sufficient to
operate their infrastruture alone.

Rackspace states that it takes a wide variety of specialized engineering skills
to architect and manage not only the insfrastructure, but also the many comples
tools and applications that run on top of it, including the latest data engines
and ecommerce platforms. Rackspace own the responsibilities to manage cloud
unlike other providers and they proudly mention that they do it differently when
compared to others. \cite{Rackspace}
